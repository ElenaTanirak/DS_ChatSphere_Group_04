# ******* ChatSphere *******

# Welcome to the Chat Application ChatSphere! 
# This application is designed to facilitate real-time communication between multiple users over a distributed network. It implements a ring topology for server communication and includes fault-tolerant features to ensure continuous operation even if a server fails. 

# To test with multiple servers, run the server script on different machines.
# Clients can join the chat by connecting to the server.
# Once connected, clients can send and receive messages in real-time.
